  DevOps / Cloud Infrastructure Engineer with 15+ years of experience across on-premises, virtualization, and cloud environments.
  Started as a Solaris and x86 systems engineer, then evolved into AWS-focused infrastructure design and DevOps automation.

  Currently building and operating production-grade AWS infrastructure — from IaC with Terraform to ECS Fargate microservices, CI/CD pipelines, centralized logging, security automation, and cost optimization.
  Experienced in managing multi-region, multi-account AWS environments for fintech and energy platform startups.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>DevOps Automation</mark>
